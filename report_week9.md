# Plan: 
Work on authentication, establish useful communication between frontend and backend, work on databases.

# Work done:
Established a lot of useful communication between frontend and backend, established authentication, deployed it almost working to homework-manager-fe.onrender.com

# Justification of differences between the plan and the work performed:
Probably did even a little bit more than I thoght I'd do, it is far easier to work on stuff when you actually understand what you're doing
# Plan on the next week:
Deploy properly, make dates work, make it so that teachers can edit drafts, just make the project as close to the specification as possible

# Problems:
Same thing as last week, no real problems, just the learning process is slow

# Changes in specification:
No changes
