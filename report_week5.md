# Plan:
Change the specification, make a mock of frontend, potentially start working on api.

# Vykonaná práca:
Changed specification, drew parts of GUI on paper, started coding frontend based on that GUI.

# Justification of differences between the plan and the work performed:
I realized that I still didn't set up everything properly, so had to readjust some things there, also got sick so it was a little difficult to work on the project.

# Plan on the next week:
Continue working on frontend, maybe start working on backend.

# Problems:
Nothing too serious, everything got fixed

# Changes in specification:
Changed the way that the project works, a new role of teacher was added and the role of admin was removed, only teachers can now add homeworks, stuents can only add homeworks and add notes to them, teachers can make drafts of homeworks that they can later publish for all the students. The application is now only meant to be used on informatics program in FMFI UK. Subjects were added as a seperate entity.
