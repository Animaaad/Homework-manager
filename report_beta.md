# Info about the reported versioin:
- Tag: beta

# Info about testing:
You need to log in as a teacher to add homeworks, the 2 teachers in my database are: 1. username: sampleUser1, password: asdasd. 2. username : sampleUser2, password: qwerty1
Then you can register as a student and look at those homeworks if you publish them as a teacher.

# How to get your development environment up and running 
download files from the github repository, then npm install reacter-router-dom in the fe folder, npm install --save-dev nodemon pg express-session connect-pg-simple bcrypt dotenv, then create tables manually (I don't have tables.sql set up properly) and run 2 dev servers with npm run dev. 

# State of implementation:
Have done adding homeworks, assignment/due dates still don't work, you cannot edit homeworks after you save them as a draft/publish them

# Time management plan:
Finish what i haven't finished, make this prettier with bootstrap

# Problems:
Deployment was an absolute nightmare, otherwise not that many problems
