# Info about the reported versioin:

# Info about testing:
You need to log in as a teacher to add homeworks, the 2 teachers in my database are: 1. username: sampleUser1, password: asdasd. 2. username : sampleUser2, password: qwerty1
Then you can register as a student and look at those homeworks if you publish them as a teacher.


# How to get your development environment up and running 
download files from the github repository, then npm install and then npm install boostrap in the fe folder, and npm install --save-dev nodemon pg express-session connect-pg-simple bcrypt dotenv in the be folder, then create tables manually (I don't have tables.sql set up properly) and run 2 dev servers with npm run dev.

# State of implementation:
I did pretty much everything I wanted to do

# Retrospective:
Wouldn't do anything differently, I think everything went pretty well, it does feel cool to create a real webite, wouldn't say Im proud of it, it's not like it's anything crazy, but it does feel nice that I created something decent.
