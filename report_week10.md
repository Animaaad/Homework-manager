# Plan: 
Deploy properly, make dates work, make it so that teachers can edit drafts, just make the project as close to the specification as possible

# Work done:
Deployed almost properly, made it so that the assignment and due dates are properly stored in the database

# Justification of differences between the plan and the work performed:
Deployment took far more time than I imagined, so I took a break after I deployed it, so only maaged to make dates work

# Plan on the next week:
probably finish the project except making it pretty

# Problems:
Deployment was a horror, so many bugs that were hard to debug

# Changes in specification:
No changes
