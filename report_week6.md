# Plan:
Change the specification, make a mock of frontend, potentially start working on api.

# Work done:
Made a couple of frontend elements, not a lot at all.

# Justification of differences between the plan and the work performed:
It's really tough to learn javascript and html when I had no exposure to either one before, hopefully I'll be able to put in more time into this next week. 

# Plan on the next week:
Finish frontend for the teacher.

# Problems:
No problems, just the learning process is slow

# Changes in specification:
Added a title and changed the descriprtion
