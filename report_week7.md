# Plan: 
Finish fronten for the teacher

# Work done:
Added a mock of registration, a home page for the teacher with a button that allows you to add homeworks locally.

# Justification of differences between the plan and the work performed:
Well, I kind of did what I wanted to do, no styling at all so far and it's still not finished, this is still not a lot at all, but it's taking me crazy time still to comprehend what is going on, going to be working daily on this project in the next 2 weeks probably.

# Plan on the next week:
Start working on backend, maybe authentication, maybe add some frontend features I don't know.

# Problems:
Same thing as last week, no real problems, just the learning process is slow

# Changes in specification:
No changes
