# Plan: 
probably finish the project except for making it pretty

# Work done:
Added almost all the features that I wanted to add except for subjects

# Justification of differences between the plan and the work performed:
Was lazy I guess, could've done a little bit more and finished off the subjects, but hopefully I am gonna do them tomorrow and then
on Tuesday I am gonna try to make it as pretty as possible (which is probably not gonna be pretty at all, but we'll see)

# Plan on the next week:
well, finish the project

# Problems:
No real problems

# Changes in specification:
No changes
