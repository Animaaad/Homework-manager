\# Plan:

Setup of the developmental environment, mock of frontend

\# Work done:

Set up git, vite.

\# Justification of differences between the plan and the work performed:

It is difficult to get into all this new world of creating web
applications, so I really only managed to set up git and vite.

\# Plan on the future week:

Change the specification, make a mock of frontend, potentially start
working on api.

\# Problems:

There was a bunch of problems with setting up git, I didnâ€™t even fully
understand why they were happening, but it worked in the end.

\# Changes in specification:

Will be done next week
