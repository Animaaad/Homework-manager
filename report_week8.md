# Plan: 
Start working on backend, maybe authentication, maybe add some frontend features

# Work done:
Added a few extra frontend fatures, established some form of communication between frontend and backend, added databases, although they don't work yet.

# Justification of differences between the plan and the work performed:
It is again incredibly difficult to not get lost in what I am doing considering I knew nothing about backend before I started, so I couldn't even establish a useful communication between fe and be for my application, I hadn't even really worked with real databases before except for a couple classes of a non-mandatory subject that I didn't pass.
# Plan on the next week:
Work on authentication, establish useful communication between frontend and backend, work on databases.

# Problems:
Same thing as last week, no real problems, just the learning process is slow

# Changes in specification:
No changes
